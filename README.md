# MystegoSteganography: Concealing Data in Digital Media
Project Overview:
Steganography is the practice of concealing information within digital media such as images, audio, or video files. This project focuses on implementing a steganographic technique to securely hide and extract sensitive data within image files. The goal is to ensure covert communication without raising suspicion, making it useful for secure data transmission.

Technical Details:

Implemented Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding for embedding data within pixel values of images.
Developed a Python-based GUI for easy encryption and decryption of messages within image files.
Ensured minimal distortion of images to prevent detection of hidden data.
Incorporated password-based encryption to enhance security before embedding data.
Applications:

Secure communication to prevent unauthorized interception.
Digital watermarking for intellectual property protection.
Concealing sensitive information in images for cybersecurity purposes.
